## Development

Vancouver styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# Install
yarn

# Run build & watch for changes
yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/edition.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
yarn zip
```

## About Vancouver Theme

If you run an online magazine or content-heavy publication, presenting your excellent writing and visuals in the best light is a top priority. 

Let us introduce you to Vancouver ‚Äì the ideal theme to showcase your hard work.

### Sleek homepage layouts 

Vancouver offers two homepage styles to choose from. 

The first features a large portrait image, perfect for publications focused on profiling people. 

The second homepage highlights an eye-catching landscape photo, ideal for travel, interior design, photography, and visual content sites.


Both homepages provide ample space to promote your newest and best content.

### Adaptable design to match your brand 

Make your site uniquely yours with custom colors. Choose any hue you like for the background. The text color will adapt automatically for optimal readability.

Pick from two classic font styles: a clean, modern sans-serif or an elegant serif. Both are optimized for legibility online.


The overall design is purposefully minimalistic to keep the focus on your writing. Every element is carefully crafted to showcase your content in the best possible light.

### Post layouts to engage readers 

Keep your audience hooked with four diverse post layout options. Alternate between full-width feature images, large typography, and more. 


### Built for speed and responsiveness  

Vancouver loads lightning-fast, thanks to the lightweight build. 

It‚Äôs fully responsive, providing a flawless viewing experience on any device, from smartphones to desktops.

### Simple customization

Use the intuitive Ghost admin panel to tweak styles, enable features, and customize your site without touching code.
